# SimpleFood WordPress Theme
SimpleFood is a custom WordPress theme I created by converting a static HTML/CSS layout into a fully functional, dynamic WordPress theme.

## ✨ What’s included
🔧 Designed and built the original layout using HTML5 and CSS3

🧩 Converted the static layout into a WordPress theme using PHP and WordPress templating

🗂️ Created three main pages with custom templates

🧱 Built reusable template parts: header.php and footer.php

🍽️ Implemented dynamic product cards using PHP and ACF (Advanced Custom Fields) — all product content is editable via the WordPress admin panel

📱 Fully responsive layout — works great across different screen sizes

🔄 Used WordPress loops and functions to make all content manageable from the admin dashboard

This theme demonstrates my ability to transform static designs into dynamic, CMS-driven websites using WordPress. Clean structure, editable content, and responsiveness make this theme suitable for real-world projects.
