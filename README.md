# SimpleFood WordPress Theme

This is a custom WordPress theme I developed by converting a static HTML/CSS layout into a fully functional WordPress theme.

## What I did

- Created the original static design and layout with HTML and CSS.
- Integrated the design into WordPress by creating theme files.
- Developed three main pages with custom templates.
- Built reusable header (`header.php`) and footer (`footer.php`) template parts.
- Implemented dynamic product cards using PHP so content can be managed from the WordPress admin panel.
- Ensured the theme is fully responsive and works well on different screen sizes.
- Used WordPress functions and loops to make content editable and manageable via the admin dashboard.

This theme demonstrates my ability to turn static designs into dynamic, CMS-driven websites with clean, maintainable code.
